# Engine

Note that this is for learning from scratch, and therefore should absolutely not be taken as a project for any serious use. Chunks of it may not work depending on what I've recently done. The code will absolutely not be ideal as I'm a first time learner (I'm usin this project to break away from Unity).

Using OpenGL and some C# wrappers alongside GLFW.NET and StbImageSharp.

Engine contains all the gubbins. Sandbox Application contains all my testbed projects, which can be toggled via Main.cs.

Work in progress.
